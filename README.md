### Computer Graphics :

The Computer Graphics course offers an in-depth exploration of the principles and techniques used to create visual content using computers. This course covers the fundamental concepts of computer graphics, including the mathematical foundations, algorithms, and hardware involved in rendering images, animations, and interactive environments.

Key Topics:

- Mathematics for Computer Graphics: Study of vectors, matrices, transformations, and geometric algorithms essential for rendering 2D and 3D graphics.
- Rendering Techniques: Introduction to various rendering methods, such as rasterization, ray tracing, and shading models, to produce realistic images.
- Graphics Programming: Hands-on experience with graphics libraries and APIs (e.g., OpenGL, DirectX, or WebGL) to implement graphical applications.
- Modeling and Animation: Techniques for creating and manipulating 3D models, as well as keyframe and skeletal animation.
- Texture Mapping and Lighting: Exploration of how textures and lighting models are used to enhance the realism of scenes.
- User Interfaces and Interaction: Development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and interactive applications, including virtual and augmented reality.
- Advanced Topics: May include discussions on real-time graphics, GPU programming, and current trends in computer graphics research.
